🛡️ Phishing Attack Simulation with Gophish 

This is a hands-on phishing simulation project using [Gophish](https://getgophish.com/), deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app) as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Simulate a phishing campaign
- Create realistic phishing templates
- Track email clicks and credential submissions
- Build user awareness of phishing threats

---

## 🔧 Tools & Stack

- Gophish (open-source phishing framework)
- Railway.app (deployment platform)
- Custom HTML email templates
- Gmail SMTP (for testing)

---

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

- ✅ Gophish deployed on Railway using Docker image
- ✅ Landing page created and attached to a campaign
- ✅ Custom phishing email crafted with realistic copy
- ✅ Emails sent and interactions logged (clicks, data entry)

## ❗ Important Notes

- This project is for **educational and defensive purposes only**.
- I do **not condone malicious phishing** in any form.
- The simulation was performed in a **controlled, safe lab environment**.
- It is intended to **help cybersecurity learners understand how phishing works**, so they can build better defenses.
- This project emphasizes the **importance of user awareness** as the first line of defense.
- Educating users on how to identify suspicious emails and links can greatly reduce the success of real-world phishing attacks.
